# Data Modeling with Postgres
### Project Overview
###### A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.
###### This project focuses on reading these files and store in a database so that it is easily available for analytics team to run their required analytics. Postgres database is used for storing the data. Fact and dimenstion tables are designed to optimize queries on song play analysis .Database schema is created and ETL pipeline is built for this analysis. Also perform testing to  database and ETL pipeline by running queries to run  analytics  and compare your results with their expected results.

### Project Description
###### In this project, data modeling is designed with Postgres database and  ETL pipeline is built using Python. Fact and dimension tables are defined for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

### Song Dataset
###### The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
*song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json*
*song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json*
###### And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
*{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}*
### Log Dataset
###### The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.
###### The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset
*log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json*
*log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json*
###### And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

### Schema for Song Play Analysis
###### Using the song and log datasets, you'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables
###### Fact Table
* songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
      * songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
###### Dimension Tables
* users - users in the app
      * user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
* user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
      song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
* artists - artists in music database
      * artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
* time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
      start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday
### Project repository details
###### In addition to the data files, the project includes six files:
1. test.ipynb displays the first few rows of each table to let you check your database.
2. create_tables.py drops and creates your tables. You run this file to reset your tables before each time you run your ETL scripts.
3. etl.ipynb reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into your tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.
4. etl.py reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into your tables. You can fill this out based on your work in the ETL notebook.
5. sql_queries.py contains all your sql queries, and is imported into the last three files above.
6. README.md provides discussion on your project.
      
### Database Design
Below is the ER diagram to understand the data base model implemented.

### ETL Process (pipeline)
###### Create_tables.py creates the all the fact and dimension tables required for the processing.  etl.py performs the major processing by reading json input file, extracts the information for further ptocessing and converts into required format and inserts into the respective tables. test.ipynb contains the sql's required to test the if the records were successfully inserted into each table

### Project execution
###### Run create_tables.py to create the postgre table ddl definitions and then run etl.py which takes the input file path and reads the json files and converts into required format and then inserts into all fact and dimension tables. Run test.ipynb to confirm your records are successfully inserted into each table.
